# A Dual Attention Network for Automatic Metallic Corrosion Detection in Natural Environment

## Abstract

Metallic corrosion in urban systems is costly and hazardous. A new method, DAMCN, using dual attention modules, has been developed to detect corrosion regions from digital images collected by unmanned aerial vehicles.

## Structure:

CBAM-keras: Sample code for CBAM module.

DAMCN-V1: Architecture of DAMCN-V1 model.

DAMCN-V2: Architecture of DAMCN-V2 model.

NEA-Dataset: NEA dataset and its annotations.

samples: Running scripts.
