# A Dual Attention Network for Automatic Metallic Corrosion Detection in Natural Environment

## Abstract

Metallic corrosion in urban systems is costly and hazardous. A new method, DAMCN, using dual attention modules, has been developed to detect corrosion regions from digital images collected by unmanned aerial vehicles.

## Structure:

CBAM-keras: Sample code for CBAM module.

mrcnn: Architecture of DAMCN model.

NEA-Dataset: NEA dataset and its annotations.

samples: Running scripts.
